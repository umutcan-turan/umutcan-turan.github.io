				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<div class="text">
				<p>Hello! I am Umutcan, an aspiring programmer on a mission to turn my passion into a career.</p>
				<p>I have been learning programming on my own for the last three years. I especially like working close to the metal, and enjoy languages like C for their simplicity. These days I am attending "Object Oriented Programming with Java" course over at <a href="https://csystem.org" target="_blank">csystem.org</a>.</p>
				<p>I am an avid Linux user and have been primarily using various distributions as my main OS for the last four years. Among those are: Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Gentoo. While I have enjoyed Gentoo on my Thinkpad T420 for the longest time, I have now settled on using Debian for most purposes.</p>
				<p>I'm used to learn on my own by reading documentation and books, and I can use the shell comfortably. My C programming environment is Bash, Make, GCC and Vim. For Java I use Eclipse.</p>
				<p>While I have no formal education regarding the computer science field, I strive to be a good programmer by taking advantage of every chance to learn new things and attending courses.</p>
				<p>I can communicate in English with ease as a direct result of the fact that the media I have consumed for the last decade has been in English, and I am currently attending a course to learn German.</p>
				<p>I am currently looking for a job where I can learn and get real world experience. In other words, money is not my primary concern for the time being. Please contact me if you think you have got a position for me.</p>
